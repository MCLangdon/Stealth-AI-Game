To play the game, run Stealth-Game/builds/Assignment3.exe. Use WASD/arrows to move the green agent. Use spacebar to teleport the closest agent (either a red guard or the purple AI agent) up to two times. Move through green cubes to pick them up while staying away from patrolling guards. Guards do not detect you while you are in an alcove. The game ends when either all items have been collected or both you and the AI have been captured. Collect the most items to win.
